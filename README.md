In improving the healthcare from the NHS there also needs to be some pressure removal where possible and practical. Aa party we wolud like to see and encourgae more social prescribing throughout the UK, in aiding people's health and wellbeing.
Each NHS Authority throught the UK needs to be allowed to function using Microsystems Approach in how it delivers it's services.  An aspect of this would be that the government health secretary needs to be taking advice and guidence from the NHS Authorities as they know their area's and what local issues are !
